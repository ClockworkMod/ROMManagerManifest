Two ways to add your ROM to ROM Manager:

1) If you want ROM Manager to automatically host and handle your ROMs,
simply visit http://romshare.deployfu.com and sign in and upload them.


2) If you want to manually host and manage your ROMs, follow these
instructions:

If you are sending a pull request (vs a github issue), please
make sure you are editing manual_manifests.js and not manifests.js.
